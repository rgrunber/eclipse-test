= ABOUT =

This is a specfile that when built into an srpm, will perform some basic
testing of the Eclipse platform while ensuring necessary dependencies are
available. Running in a mock environment makes the testing isolated and easily
reproducible.

= DEPENDENCIES =

rpm-build
rpmdevtools (optional)
mock (optional)


= HOW TO BUILD AND RUN THE SCRIPT =

Create an RPM build tree manually, or simply install rpmdevtools and have let rpmdev-setuptree set things up for you :

 $ yum install rpmdevtools
 $ rpmdev-setuptree

place the 'test.spec' file in the SPECS folder of your buildroot.
then simply run :

 $ rpmbuild -bs %{_topdir}/SPECS/test.spec

The resulting source rpm should be created in your SRPMS folder.

This can now be run on a system that satisfies the source RPMS's dependencies
or much more simply with mock.

 $ mock -r fedora-rawhide-x86_64 --init
 $ mock -r fedora-rawhide-x86_64 %{_topdir}/SRPMS/test-42-666.srpm

The build will launch eclipse and print out various diagnostic information to
help determine the state of the installation.
